# If you work for Netflix...

...then you might have a few questions. I'll try to answer them here.

### Are you modifying Netflix's apps?
No. The app is not modified in any way. It is the same app that you (Netflix) uploaded to the App Store.

### Are you bypassing any DRM or security measures?
Nope. Anyone who uses the app on MacOS must have a valid Netflix subscription to play. The app will not work without one, just like on iOS.

### Could this be used to cheat?
...at a singleplayer game?

### Could this be used to pirate Netflix?
No. The app will not work without a valid Netflix subscription, and no DRM is removed by moving the game from one device to another. It is the same app that you (Netflix) uploaded to the App Store.

### Could this be used to steal Netflix accounts?
The only way that someone "following" this guide could have their Netflix account stolen is if they ignored this [giant red box](tutorial-mac/install#if-you-are-using-this-guide-with-files-you-did-not-get-from-your-own-ios-device-you-are-in-danger) and downloaded files from the internet.

### What if you want this guide gone?
Just ask. I'll take it down. I don't want to get sued.
