# Software you'll need

:::tip
## This part of the tutorial assumes that you have completed the iOS part of the tutorial. If you have not, stop now and complete it.
There are crucial files you will need to extract from your iOS device to play the game on MacOS, and without them, nothing will work.

:::danger
## If you are using this guide with files you did not get from your own iOS device, you are in danger!

If the files were downloaded from the internet, given to you by a friend, or otherwise came from anywhere other than your own iOS device, they could be infected with **malware**. 

This malware could steal your personal information, like your Netflix password, and even get you banned from Netflix.

**If this is you, stop what you are doing and delete the files.**
