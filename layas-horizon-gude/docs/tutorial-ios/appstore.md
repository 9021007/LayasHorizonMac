Now, switch "Disable App Thinning" to Enabled, and switch "Download Options" to the last one in the list.

### Downloading Netflix

Then dismiss the popup, and search for "Netflix" in the search bar. After the results show up, tap and hold on the "Cloud" icon, and select "Upgrade/Downgrade" from the menu that appears.

The following menu will take a few seconds to load. When it does, select "14.30.0", and then install the app.

Congratulations! You have successfully downgraded Netflix. Don't open it yet, though.
It's time to download Laya's Horizon.

### Downloading Laya's Horizon

You do not need to download an older version of Laya's Horizon. The latest version will work just fine. (as of 2023/09/24)
You can download an older version if you want, but it is not required.

### Help! I just got an error because my device is not compatible with the latest version of Laya's Horizon!
**This can also apply to Netflix!**

If you get an error that says "This app is not compatible with your device", you can fix it by doing the following:

Hold down on the "Cloud" icon, and tap "Upgrade/Downgrade" from the menu that appears.

Then, wait a moment for the available versions to appear. Take a look at which one you want to use. It will have a build number next to it. Write that down, don't tap it.

Then, go back to the home screen and bring up the AppStore++ menu by holding down on your profile picture in the upper right corner of the App Store home screen.

There is a button laballed "Manual" in the upper right corner. Tap it.

Then, type in "com.netflix.NGP.SorasHorizon" (without the quotes). A webpage will pop up. Dismiss the page. Then, type in the build number you wrote down earlier. Laya's Horizon will now download. Nice work!
