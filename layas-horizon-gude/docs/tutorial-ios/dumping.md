# Dumping Netflix and Laya's Horizon

Now that Netflix and Laya's Horizon are installed, it's time to dump them.

### Make sure you have Iridum installed, as well as plenty of free space on your device.

Open Iridum. You will see a list of apps. Scroll down until you find Netflix. Tap on it.

Then, tap on "Decrypt Now". A console will pop up and show logs of the decryption process. This may take a while, depending on your device. You will know it is done when it says "Process Completed" and an "exit" icon appears. Tap that icon.

It will pop up a new menu. Tap "AirDrop", and AirDrop the new file to your Mac.

Then, **repeat this exact same dumping process for Laya's Horizon.** 

The rest of the tutorial will continue on MacOS. You can delete these apps from your device if you want, and you can delete the decrypted files from your device as well, with Filza.
